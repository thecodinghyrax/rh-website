Things seem to be testing well. Now its time to try to bring in a current copy of the db and test again.
You will need to add the mysql info to the main __init__ file and then do a create_all().
Next change the __init__ file back (so as not to commit it to github again)
Test...then deploy. You will need to do a dump of the db so you can restore it on to the website with the new changes.

Good luck my friend! -->

Running from WSL:

Installing Python and pip:  
    sudo apt update && upgrade

Navagate to your github folder and create a venv:
    python3 -m venv <name your env>

    path/to/the/env/dir source my_project/bin/activate
    or
    cd to the env/bin dir and type:
        source activate

    pip3 install -r requirments.txt
    
The JSON file currently has 10 entires that do not have an href (8/21/19)


If I ever use the register pages, I might want to put this back at the bottom of the login page:
<!-- Need An Account? <a class="ml-2" href="{{ url_for('register') }}">Sign Up</a> -->

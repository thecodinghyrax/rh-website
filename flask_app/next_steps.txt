1. from the admin page you should be able to click on one of the scheduled events
and it will pass that info to the "Add Events" pages for easy calendar functionality.

2. Add a (calendar???) search box to the admin page. this will open another page that
lists all search results with check marks by them that will allow you to delete all 
selected pages at once. Maybe redirect to the conformation page?

3. Make a page scrape script that gets the top 6 wowhead new links and stores them in the
db for faster access. This can be ran every 4 to 6 hours as a task in pythonanywhere.
